# smoothquant_kernel: task-owned v2 contract

Implement or optimize smoothquant in FlyDSL, preserving all task inputs, outputs and numerical gates.

The candidate starts **unimplemented**. The runner explicitly selects the provided baseline before loading any candidate source. An empty candidate is allowed only at initial task validation.
The original harness's primary implementation timing is retained; additional
reference/operator timings are diagnostic only. `test_kernel_harness.py` defines
the exact dispatch and allocation boundary for this task. The provided path uses
the task-local PyTorch model or installed AITER operator specified there, with its
original graph/event policy. `model.py` is protected reference/source material;
its presence alone does not select the performance baseline.

There are 6 declared cases in `cases.json`. All original dimensions,
parameter variants, seeds, tolerances, numerical metrics, output checks, warmups
and repetition counts remain in the protected harness. It validates the PyTorch
reference against the original independent AITER comparison wherever that check
was present. Small independent known-answer and negative-output controls in
`scripts/reference_controls.py` supplement the full GPU checks.

Edit only `candidate.editable` paths from `config.yaml`. Preserve each declared
public operator/builder interface and all outputs (including residuals, packed
quantization codes/scales, routing indices or state when applicable). Inspect the
protected harness calls and `model.py` to understand shapes, strides and layout.
The final operator computation must run FlyDSL GPU kernels. PyTorch is allowed
for allocation, views and launch preparation, not replacement operator compute.
Do not import the model, harness, reference or baseline from candidate code.
No Triton, AITER operator calls, external kernels, dynamic module loading, native
launch bypasses or subprocess dispatch are allowed as the final computation.
Bundled implementation utilities remain protected unless config explicitly lists
them as editable. Candidate absence, a stub or a None output is a final failure.

Use the public task-local runner from the materialized workspace:

```sh
python3 scripts/evaluate.py validate-task
python3 scripts/evaluate.py baseline compile
python3 scripts/evaluate.py baseline correctness
python3 scripts/evaluate.py baseline performance
python3 scripts/evaluate.py candidate compile
python3 scripts/evaluate.py candidate correctness
python3 scripts/evaluate.py candidate performance
```

Compile syntax-checks the actual role's Python sources; correctness then exercises
real case-specific GPU compilation and execution. Every action emits
`ARENA_EVAL_RESULT=` with an `arena-eval-v1` JSON envelope. Arena owns final scores
and reports. Agents do not write `task_result.yaml`.

The runtime image supplies ROCm, PyTorch, FlyDSL and required AITER operators. Arena
must materialize the canonical `_aka_benchmark.py` helper. CPU controls do not
establish GPU correctness or timing support. Historical validation files predate
this migration; the parent integration schedules fresh GPU validation.


The original code tolerance of one integer/FP8-byte step AND normalized maximum
scale error <= 0.001 remain unchanged, including seed 20260401 and every shape.
Return both quantized codes and FP32 scales on the input device, with the exact
contract shapes and finite values. Original Model/AITER comparison remains the
independent correctness check; the Model remains the timed provided baseline.
The unused builder declaration is removed: only the callable actually used by
correctness and timing is required.

Candidate-only import/call audits enforce FlyDSL operator computation outside
all timings. Every measured tuple and the same poisoned-output graph replay must
pass the original numerical rule. Inputs and any per-channel smoothing scales are read-only;
untimed perturbation changes signs/scales within the operand domain, then restores
the originals. Both roles retain 10 warmups and 100 graph samples.
All six cases retain INT8 truncation semantics, output shape [M,N] and scales
shape [M,1]. Replay negates activations and halves per-channel smoothing scales.
