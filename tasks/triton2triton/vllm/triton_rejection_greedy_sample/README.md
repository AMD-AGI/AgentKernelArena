# triton_rejection_greedy_sample

The starting candidate is implemented Triton. Improve the declared source files in place;
the framework freezes the initial implementation as the baseline. Baseline and candidate
actions execute only this workspace, with no fallback to another implementation.

Optimize the Triton rejection greedy sample kernel for speculative decoding. The kernel compares draft tokens against target model argmax and accepts/rejects tokens greedily.

Constraints:
- Must maintain the same function signature for `rejection_greedy_sample`
- Output must match reference exactly for integer outputs or within atol=1e-2, rtol=1e-2 for float outputs


## Evaluation contract

Run `python3 _arena_eval.py validate-task`, or `python3 _arena_eval.py baseline|candidate compile|correctness|performance`
(with one role and one action). Use `ARENA_EVAL_PHASE=candidate_evaluation` for submitted candidates.
`workloads.json` declares all five original cases; the adapter verifies it against the
protected harness table. Original input seeds, comparisons, tolerances, warmups, sample
counts and graph/event timing remain in `scripts/task_runner.py`. Compilation includes
syntax and import/interface checks. Missing candidates, incomplete measurements and
invalid timing fail; commands emit `arena-eval-v1`, never final Arena score reports.
Canonical benchmark helpers must be materialized by Arena; do not edit their generated regions.


The protected manifest requires the declared kernel symbols to remain Triton JIT
functions, including kernels originally decorated with `@triton.jit()`. Removing
the decorator is rejected before compilation. This structural check supplements
the numerical and timed-path checks; it does not by itself attest every dispatch.

## Protected evaluation controls

Controls include zero/variable draft lengths, all-accepted bonus tokens, first/late rejection and non-greedy rows. The untouched suffix and skipped rows retain their original sentinel values.

The task-local `_arena_contract.py` and `_arena_replay.py` are protected evaluation code. Original cases, seeds, tolerances, warmups, sample counts, allocations and preparation boundaries remain in `scripts/task_runner.py`. The extra `contract_controls` manifest row is correctness-only. Both the frozen baseline and candidate receive the same checks. The measured graph exposes its real outputs; an untimed replay changes a domain-valid input, recomputes the CPU oracle and restores all input buffers in `finally`. For the zero operator the replay control instead poisons its output. References and snapshots are outside device timing. Failure to observe or replay the measured invocation is an error, never an accepted timing sample.
