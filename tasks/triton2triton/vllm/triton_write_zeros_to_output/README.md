# triton_write_zeros_to_output

The starting candidate is implemented Triton. Improve the declared source files in place;
the framework freezes the initial implementation as the baseline. Baseline and candidate
actions execute only this workspace, with no fallback to another implementation.

Optimize the Triton `write_zeros_to_output` kernel for maximum GPU throughput.
This kernel zeros out a 2D tensor in tiled blocks.

Key optimization opportunities:
- Block size tuning for the target GPU
- Memory access pattern optimization (coalesced writes)

Constraints:
- Must maintain the same function signature for `write_zeros`
- Output must be all zeros after the call


## Evaluation contract

Run `python3 _arena_eval.py validate-task`, or `python3 _arena_eval.py baseline|candidate compile|correctness|performance`
(with one role and one action). Use `ARENA_EVAL_PHASE=candidate_evaluation` for submitted candidates.
`workloads.json` declares all five original cases; the adapter verifies it against the
protected harness table. Original input seeds, comparisons, tolerances, warmups, sample
counts and graph/event timing remain in `scripts/task_runner.py`. Compilation includes
syntax and import/interface checks. Missing candidates, incomplete measurements and
invalid timing fail; commands emit `arena-eval-v1`, never final Arena score reports.
Canonical benchmark helpers must be materialized by Arena; do not edit their generated regions.


## Protected evaluation controls

Zero output is checked exactly, including subnormal residuals. Replay poisons output with ones; this constant-output operator does not claim an input-dependent cache control.

The task-local `_arena_contract.py` and `_arena_replay.py` are protected evaluation code. Original cases, seeds, tolerances, warmups, sample counts, allocations and preparation boundaries remain in `scripts/task_runner.py`. The extra `contract_controls` manifest row is correctness-only. Both the frozen baseline and candidate receive the same checks. The measured graph exposes its real outputs; an untimed replay changes a domain-valid input, recomputes the CPU oracle and restores all input buffers in `finally`. For the zero operator the replay control instead poisons its output. References and snapshots are outside device timing. Failure to observe or replay the measured invocation is an error, never an accepted timing sample.
